# Stock-Price-Prediction

This project is a simple implementation of a Stock Price Predictor using Support Vector Regression (SVR) in Python. The predictor uses historical stock price data to forecast future prices. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for time series prediction.

This project uses historical stock price data to predict future stock prices. The predictor is built using the SVR model from the scikit-learn library. Three different kernels—RBF, Linear, and Polynomial—are used to train the model, and their predictions are compared.

Features
1. Support Vector Regression (SVR): Implements SVR using three different kernels (RBF, Linear, and Polynomial).
2. Data Visualization: Visualizes the data and model predictions using Matplotlib.
3. CSV Data Handling: Reads and processes stock price data from a CSV file.

Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
